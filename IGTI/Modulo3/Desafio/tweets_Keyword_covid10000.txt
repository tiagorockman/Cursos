Never in the history of American politics has there ever been a presidential candidate as spineless as @JoeBiden.   His strategy is to hide until November and blame coronavirus.  Every single person knows this is about concealing his early onset symptoms.
Fam. HIV is a virus. like the Flu. like Corona. It conveys NOTHING about the worthiness, practices or ‚Äúmorals‚Äù of the person living with it. The HIV/AIDS pandemic reflects the failures of public health. Your HIV stigma reflects the failures of public heath education. PERIODT.

Trump ended funding for 7 coronavirus testing centers yet wasted taxpayer money today on going to Wisconsin to do a town hall with Hannity. Makes sense, since he's corrupt and useless. Happy Thursday.

Because of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history - unless this stupidity is ended. We voted during World War One &amp; World War Two with no problem, but now they are using Covid in order to cheat by using Mail-Ins!
The Trump campaign put up a post of video of Biden saying Covid-19 was a hoax. They left out the part where he said President Trump says it's a hoax. 20 years ago this would have been punished severely by the political press. They served as a check on these lies. No more.
It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.  He continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
Numbers are going in the wrong direction.   Yesterday marked the 3rd-highest number of new cases (34,720) reported in one day in the US since the pandemic began. (Higher 2 dates were in April) https://t.co/9o9Q5f8pfC

Trump had a bad night in Tulsa. Very low turnout. Even his supporters know that COVID-19 is real and dangerous, and should not be spread at an indoor rally. More importantly, maybe people are catching on that he is a pathological liar and a fraud. Let's keep fighting.
Trump's rally in Tulsa is indoors, with no social distancing and no mask requirements‚Äîall in violation of CDC guidelines. Trump is willing to spread the COVID-19 virus in order to hear some cheers. He is a direct threat to the health of the American people. He must be defeated.
120,000 Americans are dead from the worst pandemic in a century, &amp; the President said tonight that he slowed down testing so the public death toll wouldn't be worse.  We still don't have a national testing strategy &amp; Trump's plan is to bury his head. This is a deadly failure.
Father's Day is a good day to remind people that all phone calls and video calls for incarcerated people should be free in every prison and jail across the country. Not just during a pandemic, not just during holidays, not as a special privilege. But for everyone, all year round.

If coronavirus cases are increasing, then we can thanks the "mostly peaceful protestors" as it takes 10-14 days for the virus to present itself. ¬† And thanks to the blue-state mayors and governors and so-called experts who sanctified it all.
